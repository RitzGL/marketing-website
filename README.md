Creating fresh repository with updated files.

This repo will feature all assets, for the code refactoring assignment. 

Additionally, the HTML and CSS files will be found here, as well. 

Some changes: 
  -combined certain classes together
    -ie .benefit-lead
        .benefit-brand
        .benefit-cost
        .search-engine-optimization
        .online-reputation-management
        .social-media-marketing
        
More classes will be coupled together, it seems. If so, they will be added to the list. 

Deleted following redundant class and specifiers for a <ul>:
     .header div ul{
        list-style-type: none;
      }

If more changes are made, README.md will be updated accordingly.
